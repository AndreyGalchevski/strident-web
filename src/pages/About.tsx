              Strident is a thrash metal band formed in 2004 in the ancient city
              of Be`er Sheva (Israel). Starting from playing cover versions of
              such famous groups as Iron Maiden, AC / DC, etc and having come a
              long way, they found their style on the Israeli metal scene,
              despite the fact that in those years the scene was flooded with
              black metal and many hardcore bands. The group released its first
              album “On Aim” (2010), which raised the main problems of this
              world, on its own, thus challenging other popular styles. This
              album has become somewhat legendary, as it was the first
              full-length thrash metal album released in Israel back in the day.
              On 29 November 2019, their second album will out worldwide through
              Punishment 18 Records. The best thrash for lovers and connoisseurs
              of this style.
